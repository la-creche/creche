# rust

Rules for all Rust code in this repository. The root `AGENTS.md` applies here
too.

The Rust code uses type-driven design. A type permits only valid values. Code
that holds a value does not check the value again. The compiler then refuses a
defect that a test finds late.

## Layout

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` | The workspace, the dependency versions and the lint gate. |
| `Cargo.lock` | The locked versions. Commit it. Each gate command uses `--locked`. |
| `rust-toolchain.toml` | The one toolchain version. rustup reads it for each cargo command under `rust/`. |
| `rustfmt.toml` | The line width: 100, the same as ruff. |
| `clippy.toml` | The lints that a test can break. |
| `crates/<name>/` | One crate. Each directory there is a workspace member. |

| Crate | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `creche-contracts` | The wire types and the config types of the contracts. `ids::FamilyName` is the pattern for each new type. |

## Checks

You need rustup. It installs the toolchain at the first cargo command under
`rust/`.

1. Run each cargo command from `rust/`. rustup finds the toolchain file only
   from there.
2. Run `bin/rust-gate.sh --tests` before you push. CI runs the same script.

`bin/rust-gate.sh` runs these steps in this order:

1. The `[lints]` check. Each crate must take the lint gate.
2. The include check. No Rust source file includes a Markdown file.
3. `cargo fmt --all --check`.
4. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`.
5. `cargo test --workspace --locked`, with `--tests` only.

`bin/quality-gate.sh` starts `bin/rust-gate.sh` only for a change that
touches `rust/`. `bin/AGENTS.md` has the table. Every path under `rust/`
counts, a Markdown file too. The exception is a push of Markdown files only.
That push runs the tests marked `docs` and no cargo step.

A push that changes a path under `vectors/` is the one other case. It starts
`bin/rust-gate.sh` when `cargo` is on `PATH`. In CI, a code change under
`vectors/` runs the `rust` job.

## The rules

Each rule has its reason. Do not break a rule without a change to this file.

1. **Parse at the edge.** Untyped data becomes a raw `serde` type first. A
   conversion that can fail then makes the valid type. Code after the
   conversion never sees an invalid value.
   Reason: one conversion holds every check, so no code path can skip a
   check.
2. **Give each id, name, path, size, duration and token its own type.** The
   type has a private field and a parsing constructor. Do not implement
   `Default`. Do not derive `Deserialize` directly. Use
   `#[serde(try_from = "...")]`, so `serde` reads through the constructor.
   Reason: a public field, a `Default` and a direct `Deserialize` are each a
   constructor that skips the check.
3. **Make a closed set an enum.** An enum can cross a process boundary. For
   each such enum, the doc comment of the type says what a reader does with
   an unknown value. The reader refuses the value, or accepts it as an
   `Unknown` variant.
   Reason: components release separately, so a reader can get a value from a
   newer writer.
4. **Return `Result` with a typed error enum from a function that can fail.**
   Do not use `anyhow` in a library crate.
   Reason: the signature shows each failure, and the compiler makes the
   caller handle each one. An error with no type hides them.
5. **Do not use `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!` or a `[]` index outside a test.**
   The lint gate refuses them. Write an exception as
   `#[expect(clippy::<lint>, reason = "...")]` on one item. Never write
   `#[allow]`. The lint gate refuses it. It also refuses an `#[expect]` that
   gives no reason.
   Reason: each one stops the process on a value that the code did not
   expect. `#[expect]` fails the build when the exception is not necessary,
   and `#[allow]` stays.
6. **Give a secret its own type.** The type has a `Debug` that prints no
   secret. It has no `Display` and no `Serialize`.
   Reason: the secret then cannot go to a log line, to a page or to a wire by
   accident.
7. **Do not put `serde_json::Value` in a contract type.** The exception is a
   field that the contract calls opaque.
   Reason: a `Value` holds any shape, so the type checks nothing.
8. **State the failure action at each process edge.** A process edge is a
   place where a process parses a file, a config or a message. The code
   there says what occurs when the parse fails. It keeps the last good value
   and publishes a fault, or it refuses, or it exits with `EX_CONFIG`, which
   is exit status 78. A daemon must not restart in a loop on an invalid
   value.
   Reason: the types say nothing about a parse that fails. A daemon that
   exits on an invalid file and starts again each 5 seconds is an outage.
9. **Do not use a regex for an id grammar.** Write the check by hand over
   ASCII bytes.
   Reason: in a Rust pattern, `\d` and `\w` also match characters that are
   not ASCII. A check over bytes has one meaning and needs no crate.
10. **Give each contract type a differential test against the Python
    implementation.** A later change adds shared vector files under
    `vectors/`.
    Reason: the Python code is the behavior that runs on the host. A port
    that passes only its own tests can differ from that behavior.
11. **Keep Rust code under `rust/` until a release of its component uses
    the Rust code.** Do not put a Cargo file at the repository root or in a
    package directory.
    Reason: the tag allocator (`handover/src/handover/allocate.py`) mints a
    tag for a component when a path under that component changes. A path
    under `rust/` is under no component, so a change here mints no tag and
    starts no release.

## Code style

The code style rules of the root `AGENTS.md` apply. In Rust they read:

- Extract a repeated or meaningful value into a named `const`. Keep a one-off
  value inline.
- Return early. Use `?` and `let ... else`. Avoid deep nesting.
- Keep function names under 30 characters. The name of a test is a
  sentence and can be longer.
- Use an enum, not a `bool`, for a function parameter.
- Put a blank line between logical blocks.
- Keep an item private unless the design needs it public. Use `pub(crate)`
  before `pub`. Ask before you widen visibility.
- A layer talks only to the layer directly below it.
- `cargo fmt` sets the format. Do not format by hand.

## The lint gate

`[workspace.lints]` in `Cargo.toml` is the lint gate. It forbids `unsafe`
code. It denies a `Result` that the code drops without a check. It denies
the lints of rule 5 and these: `todo`, `unimplemented`, `unreachable`,
`string_slice`, `as_conversions`, `unwrap_in_result`, `panic_in_result_fn`,
`await_holding_lock`, `dbg_macro`, `exit` and `mem_forget`. It warns about a
public type with no `Debug`. clippy runs with `-D warnings`, so a warning
also fails the gate.

Two more lints hold the exception rule of rule 5. `allow_attributes` denies
each `#[allow]`. `allow_attributes_without_reason` denies an `#[expect]` that
gives no reason. Without them, one attribute lifts the lint gate for an item
or for a crate.

`bin/tests/test_rust_workspace.py` pins each entry of the lint gate and of
`clippy.toml`. To change an entry, change the pin in the same commit. Give
the reason in the commit message.

- Each crate has these two lines in its `Cargo.toml`: `[lints]`, then
  `workspace = true`. Write them in that form. `bin/rust-gate.sh` reads no
  other spelling and refuses a crate without them.
- A crate without the two lines builds with no lint of the workspace. cargo
  does not tell you.
- `clippy.toml` lets a test use `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!` and a `[]`
  index.
- A test function returns `()`. The lint gate refuses an assertion or an
  `unwrap` in a function that returns `Result`, in a test too.
- Put a test helper in a `#[cfg(test)]` module. clippy does not count a
  helper outside such a module as test code, in a file under `tests/` too.
- The lint gate reads the text of the code. Code that passes it can panic,
  for example on a division by zero.

## Tests

- Put the unit tests of a module in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in the same
  file.
- Give each parsing constructor one table of accepted texts and one table of
  refused texts. For a text grammar, refuse a final newline and a digit that
  is not ASCII.
- Give each type with a private field a `compile_fail` doc test. It shows
  that code outside the module cannot build the type from a raw value. Put a
  doc test that compiles beside it, with the same `use` line. A wrong path
  then cannot make the `compile_fail` test pass.
- An error code on a `compile_fail` test, for example `E0423`, is a note for
  the reader. The toolchain of this workspace does not check the code. The
  test passes on each compile error.
- A Rust test reads no file outside `rust/` and `vectors/data`. The gate
  runs cargo only for a change under `rust/` or `vectors/`, so a change to a
  file elsewhere does not run the test. If a later change needs such a file,
  add its directory to `bin/lib/rustrule.sh` first.
- A Rust source file includes no Markdown file. A push of Markdown files
  only runs no cargo step. `bin/rust-gate.sh` refuses a line that holds
  `include_str!`, `include_bytes!` or `include!` and a name that ends in
  `.md`.
- A push that changes only `rust/` runs no pytest suite. A Python test that
  reads a file under `rust/` then runs first in CI.
  `bin/tests/test_rust_workspace.py` is such a test.

## Dependencies

- Write each dependency version one time, in `[workspace.dependencies]`. A
  crate refers to it with `workspace = true`.
- Add a third-party crate only when the code needs it. Each crate adds code
  that no person here reviews.
- A crate has no `version` key. No number lives in a file. A version is a
  tag that CI allocates.
- Commit `Cargo.lock` with each change to a dependency.

## Known gaps

- `FamilyName` has no differential test against the Python implementation.
  Rule 10 needs the shared vector files, and they do not exist.
- CI does not run `cargo deny`. No check reads the advisories or the
  licenses of the locked crates.
- No release uses Rust code. The component manifest has no kind for a
  compiled binary.
- No `CONTRACT-QUESTION` is open in this directory. The two Python copies of
  the family name grammar agree.
