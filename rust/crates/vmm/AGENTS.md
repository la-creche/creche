# vmm

The crate `creche-vmm`: a library and the program `vmm` (decisions CH9,
CH7-5). One `vmm` process owns every Cloud Hypervisor VM of the playpen.
The root `AGENTS.md` applies here too.

## The three crates

| Crate | Directory | Calls |
|---|---|---|
| `creche-vmm` | `rust/crates/vmm` | `creche-vmm-confine`, `creche-vmm-store`, `creche-wire` |
| `creche-vmm-confine` | `rust/crates/vmm-confine` | `creche-vmm-store`, `creche-wire` |
| `creche-vmm-store` | `rust/crates/vmm-store` | `creche-wire` |

- `creche-vmm` composes two libraries: `creche-vmm-confine` and
  `creche-vmm-store`. `creche-vmm-confine` reads the types of
  `creche-vmm-store`.
- A crate calls only the crates in its row. For these three crates, this
  table replaces the layer rule of the root `AGENTS.md`.
- Each `Cargo.toml` declares every path edge of the table. A change adds
  no path edge.

## The program

`src/main.rs` documents the modes of `vmm` and the exit status 78.

## The server

`src/server/` holds the host API server (decisions CH20, CH26).
`server::run_with` accepts on a socket path that its caller passes in and
serves one HTTP/1.1 connection per accept, with upgrades on. The protocol
header is the first check of each request (decisions CH33 rule 1, CH34
rule 1). `server::run` answers each request that passes with `no_route`
until the server has routes. `Stop` stops the server through
`tokio::sync` (decision CH26 rule 2).

`examples/upgrade_echo/` is a server with one handler that echoes after
101. `tests/upgrade_body.rs` and `integration/proc/test_proc_vmm_upgrade.py`
use it to prove that the JSON body of an Upgrade request crosses
(`wire/AGENTS.md`, the `acp` route).

## Rules

- Each new dependency is its own pull request, with its lock delta
  (decision CH9-1).
- A library returns a typed error. Only `src/main.rs` turns an error into
  an exit status.
- A crate exposes `pub` items only for the crates that list it in their
  row (decision CH36, gap G24 of the phase 2 plan).

## Known gaps

None.
